Organiser is an app created to keep track of stored items in boxes or containers.
The main idea of this app is to take a photo of an item, throw it to the container, label it in an app and quickly find it when it is needed again.

App is made of 3 elements:
- location - general description of a place, for example: garage, attic
- container - specific container labeled with sticker
- item - stored item that can be found by name look up (may contain image, description adn quantity info)
